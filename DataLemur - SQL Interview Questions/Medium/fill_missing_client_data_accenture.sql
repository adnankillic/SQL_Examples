/*When you log in to your retailer client's database, you notice that their product catalog data is full of gaps in the category column. 
Can you write a SQL query that returns the product catalog with the missing data filled in?

Assumptions

Each category is mentioned only once in a category column.
All the products belonging to same category are grouped together.
The first product from a product group will always have a defined category.
Meaning that the first item from each category will not have a missing category value.

Explanation:
Shoes will replace all NULL values below the product Sperry Boat Shoe until Jeans appears. Similarly, Jeans will replace NULLs for the product Wrangler Straight Fit, and so on.

products Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
category	varchar
name	varchar
